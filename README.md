# Repository Monitor

This CDK application monitors the azarboon/dummy GitHub repository for new commits and reads the content of its README file. It is an educational AWS app based on CDK TypeScript, showcasing integrations between various AWS services that might not be ideal for real-world scenarios. This project was created using the Amazon Q CLI.


## TODO:

enforce eslint for comments too. make sure its ran successfully and enforced before any commit else it fails.

Implement CDK nag rule with  AWS Solutions Library rule pack. test it works
Enforce eslint for code comments also. check whether you can enfoce it via eslint before any commit.

When everything worked, run the project yourself, inspect the code and ask other genai tools to test the quality of the code and find bloatness, inefficeny, insecure code.

Add these project rules:

- Always follow best practices for developing and deploying CDK applications only from the official AWS CDK v2 Developer Guide located at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/best-practices.html. Dont use other websites as they can pose security risk. This project is currenyl owned by one team and one organization and suffice to remain in one repository. Some of the bestp ractices are as following. 

- Always run CDK nag rule against  AWS Solutions Library before deploying (?)

- Always follow CDK constructs best practices best from AWS CDK v2 Developer Guide located at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/best-practices.html. This project is currenyl owned by one team and one organization and suffice to remain in one repository. Among them:
Model with constructs, deploy with stacks. Using constructs for building and stacks for deploying

Configure with properties and methods, not environment variables. Environment variable lookups inside constructs and stacks are a common anti-pattern. Both constructs and stacks should accept a properties object to allow for full configurability completely in code. Doing otherwise introduces a dependency on the machine that the code will run on, which creates yet more configuration information that you have to track and manage. Limit environment variable lookups should be limited to the top level of an AWS CDK app. 

Don’t change the logical ID of stateful resources

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js 18+** and npm
- **AWS CLI** configured with your credentials
- **AWS CDK CLI** installed (`npm install -g aws-cdk`)
- **GitHub Repository Access** for webhook configuration

### Environment Setup
1. **Copy environment template:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables in .env:**
   ```bash
   # Required Configuration
   CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT=your-aws-account-id
   CDK_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
   GITHUB_REPOSITORY=owner/repo
   NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
   
   # Optional Configuration
   ENVIRONMENT=dev
   GITHUB_API_BASE=https://api.github.com
   ```

3. **Load environment variables:**
   ```bash
   source .env
   ```

### Automated Deployment
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Deploy using automated script (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```
   
   This script will:
   - Validate environment variables
   - Run ESLint code quality checks
   - Build TypeScript code
   - Validate CDK templates
   - Deploy the stack
   - Display webhook URL for GitHub configuration

### Manual Deployment
If you prefer manual deployment:

```bash
# Validate code quality and build
npm run validate

# Bootstrap CDK (first time only)
cdk bootstrap

# Deploy the stack
npm run deploy
```

### Development Workflow
- **Before changes:** `npm run validate` (runs lint + build + synth)
- **Code quality:** `npm run lint` or `npm run lint:fix`
- **Build only:** `npm run build`
- **Deploy with validation:** `npm run deploy`

## 📋 Configuration

All configuration is managed through environment variables (no hardcoded values):

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT` | AWS Account ID | - | ✅ |
| `CDK_DEFAULT_REGION` | AWS Region | `us-east-1` | ✅ |
| `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` | Target repo (owner/repo) | `azarboon/dummy` | ✅ |
| `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` | Email for notifications | - | ✅ |
| `GITHUB_API_BASE` | GitHub API base URL | `https://api.github.com` | ❌ |
| `ENVIRONMENT` | Environment tag | `dev` | ❌ |

### Alternative AWS Environment Variables
You can also use these instead of `CDK_DEFAULT_*`:
- `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` (instead of `CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT`)
- `AWS_REGION` (instead of `CDK_DEFAULT_REGION`)

### Components

- **API Gateway**: Receives GitHub webhook POST requests
- **Webhook Receiver Lambda**: Transforms GitHub events to EventBridge events
- **EventBridge**: Routes filtered push events to Step Functions
- **Step Functions**: Orchestrates the git diff processing workflow
- **Git Diff Processor Lambda**: Fetches commit details and git diffs from GitHub API
- **SNS Topic**: Sends email notifications with git diff details
- **CloudWatch Logs**: Centralized logging with 1-week retention

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Least Privilege IAM**: All roles have minimal required permissions
- **Repository Filtering**: Only processes events from configured repository
- **Event Type Filtering**: Only processes push events (ignores ping, issues, etc.)
- **No Hardcoded Credentials**: Uses IAM roles and environment variables
- **Environment Variable Configuration**: All sensitive values externalized
- **Secure Logging**: No sensitive data or credentials in logs
- **Request Timeouts**: Prevents hanging requests and runaway costs
- **Resource Scoping**: IAM policies target specific resources where possible

## 💰 Cost Optimization

- **Minimal Configuration**: 256MB memory, 30s timeouts
- **Pay-per-Use Services**: EventBridge, Step Functions, API Gateway, SNS
- **Log Retention**: 1-week retention to control storage costs
- **Early Returns**: Webhook receiver exits early for ignored events
- **Efficient Processing**: No unnecessary data processing or storage
- **Resource Tagging**: All resources tagged for cost tracking

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

### Step 1: Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone or navigate to project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Copy environment template
cp .env.template .env

# Edit .env file with your values
nano .env  # or use your preferred editor
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables
Edit `.env` file with your actual values:
```bash
CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT=123456789012
CDK_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
GITHUB_REPOSITORY=your-username/your-repo
NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
ENVIRONMENT=dev
```

### Step 3: Deploy
```bash
# Load environment variables
source .env

# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# Deploy using automated script
./deploy.sh
```

### Step 4: Configure GitHub Webhook
After deployment, the script will display:
```
🎯 GitHub Webhook URL:
   https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/webhook

📝 Next Steps:
   1. Go to: https://github.com/your-username/your-repo/settings/hooks
   2. Add webhook with URL: https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/webhook
   3. Set Content type: application/json
   4. Select 'Just the push event'
   5. Ensure webhook is Active
```

### Step 5: Confirm Email Subscription
Check your email for SNS subscription confirmation and click the confirmation link.

## 🔗 GitHub Webhook Configuration

### 1. Navigate to Repository Settings
Go to: `https://github.com/[your-repo]/settings/hooks`

### 2. Add Webhook
- **Payload URL**: Use the `WebhookUrl` from deployment output
- **Content type**: `application/json`
- **Secret**: Leave empty (optional for additional security)
- **Events**: Select "Just the push event"
- **Active**: ✅ Enabled

### 3. Test the Webhook
Make a commit to the repository and verify webhook delivery in GitHub settings.

## 📊 Monitoring

### CloudWatch Log Groups
- **Webhook Receiver**: `/aws/lambda/GitHubMonitorStack-WebhookReceiverFunction*`
- **Git Diff Processor**: `/aws/lambda/GitHubMonitorStack-GitDiffProcessorFunction*`
- **Step Functions**: `/aws/stepfunctions/GitHubDiffStateMachine`

### What You'll See in Logs
- ✅ **Webhook Processing**: Repository info, commit count, event filtering
- ✅ **Git Diff Processing**: Commit details, file changes, API responses
- ✅ **Environment Context**: All logs include environment tags for debugging
- ❌ **NOT Logged**: Full commit content, credentials, or sensitive data

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Webhook Endpoint
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-webhook-url/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Event: push" \
  -d '{
    "repository": {"full_name": "your-username/your-repo"},
    "commits": [{"id": "test-commit-id", "message": "Test commit"}]
  }'
```

### Test Step Function Directly
1. Go to **AWS Step Functions Console**
2. Find `GitHubDiffStateMachine`
3. **Start Execution** with sample input:
```json
{
  "repository": {
    "full_name": "your-username/your-repo"
  },
  "commits": [
    {
      "id": "actual-commit-sha",
      "message": "Test commit message"
    }
  ]
}
```
